# 🧮 Simple Python Calculator

This is a basic Python calculator program that takes **two numbers** as input and automatically calculates:

- ✅ Sum
- ✅ Difference
- ✅ Multiplication
- ✅ Division (Quotient)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the **first** and **second** number.
2. Once the numbers are entered, it displays the result of:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division (if the second number is not zero)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Example

If the user enters:
- First number: `5`
- Second number: `4`

The output will be:

Sum: 5.0 + 4.0 = 9.0
Difference: 5.0 - 4.0 = 1.0
Multiplication: 5.0 * 4.0 = 20.0
Division (Quotient): 5.0 / 4.0 = 1.25

## ⚠️ Notes
- The program checks for **invalid input** (non-numeric values).
- It handles **division by zero** and gives a proper error message.
